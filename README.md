# data-structure
A collection of data structures as defined in https://runestone.academy/runestone/static/pythonds/index.html written in Go. The data structures includes:

- Stack
- Queue
- Deque
- List
- (More will be added soon)

These data structures are not intended for reinventing basic data types in Go such as `array` and `slice`. However, they provide wrappers for commonly used functionalities of various data structures as studied in the literature.
